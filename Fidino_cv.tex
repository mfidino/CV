\section{Education}
\cventry {2013 -- 2017}{Ph.D.}{Ecology and Evolution}
{University of Illinois at Chicago}{}{Advisors: Joel Brown, Seth Magle, and Chris Whelan}
\cventry{2005 -- 2009}{B.S.}{Environmental Science}
{Western Washington University}{}{Advisor: David Wallin}

\section{Professional Experience}
\cventry{2017 -- Present}{Quantitative Ecologist}{Urban Wildlife Institute}{Lincoln Park Zoo}{Chicago, IL}{In this role I closely collaborate with conservation and science staff at the Lincoln Park Zoo to better manage and analyze data from a wide variety of sources, from touchscreen cognition tests for primates to nation-wide camera trapping projects. My own research in this position primarily focuses on developing new tools and techniques that better incorporate a species natural history into a statistical model and help address basic and applied questions related to how species respond to habitat fragmentation.}
\cventry {2015 -- 2017}{Ecological Analyst}{Urban Wildlife Institute}{Lincoln Park Zoo}{Chicago, IL}{In this role I worked to develop techniques to better manage and analyze ecological data and assist other science centers across the Lincoln Park Zoo with statistical analyses, data management, and computer programming. I also developed statistics and computer programming workshops for staff. Finally, I helped initiate a large-scale citizen science project, Chicago Wildlife Watch (\httplink{www.chicagowildlifewatch.org}) and have written extensive software to verify and upload data to the project.}
\cventry{2014 -- Present}{Analytics Advisor}{Urban Wildlife Information Network}{}{}{The Urban Wildlife Information Network (UWIN) is the world's first systematic multi-city urban wildlife monitoring network. To facilitate the collection and analysis of these data I worked closely with a tech company in Chicago to develop a website and SQL datatbase to store camera trapping images, identify species in images, and summarize the data for varying analyses. Furthermore, I work with partners in over 17 cities to answer any database or analysis question they may have.}
\cventry {2012 -- 2015}{Coordinator of Wildlife Management}{Urban Wildlife Institute}{Lincoln Park Zoo}{Chicago, IL}{Led research of wildlife on zoo grounds, which included daily avian point counts, tracking relocated turtles in a newly restored pond habitat, on grounds rabbit management, arthropod surveys, and monitoring a nesting colony of state-endangered Black-crowned Night Herons (\textit{Nycticorax nycticorax}). To do all of this work, I managed and trained teams of interns each year, mentored them on urban ecology, and helped them present their work to their peers at the Lincoln Park Zoo. Additionally, I collaborated extensively with the Lincoln Park Zoo's education department on numerous projects to educate zoo visitors on wildlife conservation efforts throughout Chicago. }
\cventry{2011 -- 2012}{Research Intern}{Urban Wildlife Institute}{Lincoln Park Zoo}{Chicago, IL}{Aided with field work and data entry for the Urban Wildlife Institute's biodiversity monitoring survey, helped with research on zoo grounds, and created year-end permit reports. }
\cventry{2009 -- 2010}{Environmental Technician}{Environmental Assessment Services}{}{Richland, WA}{Assisted with numerous biological research projects at the Hanford superfund site.}
